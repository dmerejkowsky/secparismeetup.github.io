# Paris Security Meetup

This repository aims to gather everything around the "Paris Security Meetup" events,
taking place at Dashlane's offices
([*21 Rue Pierre Picard, 75018 Paris*](http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=19/48.88474/2.34489) ;
Metro station "*Barbès-Rochechouart*", lines 2 and 4).

The *real* homepage is hosted on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/SecParis-Meetup/).

## Discussions

All the discussions are taking place in the
[Issues](https://github.com/SecParisMeetup/secparismeetup.github.io/issues)
of this repository. Feel free to contribute to it even if you're not one active
member—all the thoughts are welcome!

## Submit a talk / workshop...

Just open a Pull Request agains this repository, by creating a new file inside `./_talks`,
using the file `example.md` as template. Then, we'll talk about it: we don't have any reason to reject it, anyway :-)

You can also [send me an email](mailto:thomas+meetup@chauchefoin.fr) if you're
allergic at Github. 

If you already did a blog post or a talk on this subject, don't hesitate to drop
us some links to it.

While we try to do everything in English, French documents are welcome too. In this
case, the content will be translated in English and both versions will be distributed, so
everybody can enjoy it.
