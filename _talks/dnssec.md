## Description

"The Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a suite of Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) specifications for securing certain kinds of
information provided by the Domain Name System (DNS) as used on Internet
Protocol (IP) networks. It is a set of extensions to DNS which provide to DNS
clients (resolvers) origin authentication of DNS data, authenticated denial of
existence, and data integrity, but not availability or confidentiality." ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions)).

This talk will give an overview of the DNS system, some cryptography basics
necessary to fully understand the specification and a presentation of the
different use cases where DNSSec can be useful.
