## Description

To break into a building, several methods have already been discussed, such as
trying to find the code paths of a digicode, clone RFID cards, use some social
engineering attacks, or the use of archaic methods like lockpicking a door lock
or breaking a window.

New methods are now possible with recent intercoms. Indeed, these intercoms are
used to call the tenants to access the building. But little study has been
performed on how these boxes communicate to request and grant access to the
building.

In the past, they were connected with wires directly to apartments. Now, these
are more practical and allow residents to open doors not only from their classic
door phone, but to forward calls to their home or mobile phone. Private houses
are now equipped with these new devices and its common to find these “connected”
intercoms on recent and renovated buildings.

In this presentation we will introduce the Intercoms and focus on one particular
devices that is commonly installed in buildings today. Then we will present our
analysis on an interesting attack vector, which already has its own history.
After this analysis, we will present our environment to test the intercoms, and
show some practical attacks and our results that could be performed on these
devices. During this talks, the evolution of our mobile lab and some advances on
the 3G intercoms attacks will be also presented.
