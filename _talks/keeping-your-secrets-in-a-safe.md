## Description

At [tanker.io](https://www.tanker.io/), we take security seriously.

We have a safe in our office to keep our secrets like signature private
certificates, SSH keys and the like.

In this talk, we'll explain why the safe is mostly always *opened* during
office hours. (Spoiler: it has to do with the fact that we are humans)
